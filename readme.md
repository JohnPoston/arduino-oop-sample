#Arduino Object Oriented Programming
###A short sample code on how to define classes and instantiate objects using the Arduino development board

This is a **quick and dirty sample sketch** for the Arduino which I made for myself in order to remember how to make objects using C/C++ syntax easily.
To goal of the project is to make my own code more readeable, stuctured and easier to develop additional features.

## Features
- the Arduino can treat it's PINs as objects
- classes and it's methods can be stored in separated .h files (typical C syntax)
